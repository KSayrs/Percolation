## Percolation

Project done for an upper-level CSC course. For this project, the students wrote the Pecolation.java and PercolationStats.java files. This was made using [the algs4 library](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/).

Percolation. Given a composite system comprised of randomly distributed insulating and metallic materials: what fraction of the materials need to be metallic so that the composite system is an electrical conductor? Given a porous landscape with water on the surface (or oil below), under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom (or the oil to gush through to the surface)? Scientists have defined an abstract process known as percolation to model such situations.

This program estimates the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.

For info on the project process, see the readme.txt.

## Usage
Every file has a test client. PercolationVisualizer and InteractivePercolationVisualizer best demonstrate the program.
